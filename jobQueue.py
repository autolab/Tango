# JobQueue - This class defines the job queue and the functions for
# manipulating it. The actual queue is made up of two smaller
# sub-lists:
#
# - The active list is a dictionary, keyed off job ID, that holds all
#   jobs that are active, including those not yet assigned to a worker
#   thread.  The trace attribute of a job being None indicates that
#   the job is not yet assigned.  Only the JobManager thread can
#   assign jobs to Workers.
#
# - The dead list is a dictionary of the jobs that have completed.
#
