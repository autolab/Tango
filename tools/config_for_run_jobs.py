      - '8600:8600'
      - '6380:6379'
  '''
  # The first port pair is for tango. The port before ":" is on the host and
  # the other (optional) inside the container if tango/redis are run in a
  # container.  The second line is for redis.
  # Sometimes we run multiple tango/redis containers on the same host for
  # separate experiments.  To access different tango/redis, we can give them
  # different on-host port numbers, hence the need for the HostPort variables.
  # A util script can reach the desirable entity using those varialbes.
