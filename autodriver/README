To build a grading vm image for Autolab jobs:

Create a vm with a stock linux image
Copy autodriver.c and Makefile to the vm and compile it to autodriver
Copy autodriver to any common path, make it owned by root wtih setuid bits.
For example: -rwsr-sr-x 1 root root /usr/bin/autodriver

Create the following users
autolab: The ssh/scp user tied with selected key pair of you cloud account
autograde: The user to run TA's grader starting from the top Makefile (see autodriver.c)
student: For student to use the exact image for coding/testing

The sequence of grading using the above image is such:

The grading engine: scp top level Makefile, autograde.tar (both made by course staff)
and student's submission to the grading vm.

The grading engine: ssh to run autodriver program.

The greating vm: autodriver program (running as root because of the setuid bit) starts
a child process (running as user autograde) to run "make" with top level Makefile.

The grading engine: scp the output file from the grading vm.
