# Autolab Docker Deployment
This is the official Docker Compose installation method for [Autolab](https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/) and [Tango](https://github.com/autolab/Tango/).

The Autolab Docker Compose installation is a fast and easy production-ready installation and deployment method. It uses a MySQL database for the Autolab deployment, and comes with SSL support. This is now the preferred way of installing Autolab. 

## Installation
Please refer to our official [Autolab docs](http://docs.autolabproject.com/docker-compose) for installation instructions.

If you are stuck or find issues with the installation process please join our Slack [here](https://autolab-slack.herokuapp.com/) and let us know and we will try our best to help.
