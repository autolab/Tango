#
# JobManager - Thread that assigns jobs to worker threads
#
# The job manager thread wakes up every so often, scans the job list
# for new unassigned jobs, and tries to assign them.
#
# Assigning a job will try to get a preallocated VM that is ready,
# otherwise will pass 'None' as the preallocated vm.  A worker thread
# is launched that will handle things from here on. If anything goes
# wrong, the job is made dead with the error.
